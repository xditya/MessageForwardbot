# Message Forwarder Bot

Idk why this exists in the first place, anyways..
This bot sends the message to the target group from a group. (yes, that's it).

## Setting up 
* First:
> `APP_ID` and `API_HASH` - Get it from my.telegram.org   
> `BOT_TOKEN` - Get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)   
* Chose a platform to deploy on:
<details>
<summary>Heroku/Kintohub/Zeet</summary>
<br>
Add them to the environment vars.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Local Deoploys</summary>
<br>
Make a `.env` file in the root of the repo, like `.env.sample` and fill in the values.   
</details>
# Usage
Add me to both the groups first...
Use `/frwd <to group id/username> <message/reply to message>` to forward the message to that group.
